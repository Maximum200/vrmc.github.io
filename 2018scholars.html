<h3> Q1: What is one fond memory you have of VRMC? </h3>
<p> The fondest memory I have of my time in VRMC would be spending time with my friends/CCA-mates working on a VEX competition play field. 
  We often spent 3-5 days after school in the robotics lab cutting out parts and building structures for the play field. 
  Although it was a really time consuming and tiring project, it was a breath of fresh air compared to the tiring mugger lifestyle of the typical JC student, 
  and it also provided the extra benefit of giving me more time to interact and have fun with my CCA-mates and friends. 
  Even then, every session was something I looked forward to, and made my JC life that much more wholesome and enjoyable. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q2. What made you apply for this scholarship? </h3>
<p> I applied for the SUTD Global Merit Scholarship under the Special Scholarship Agreement (SSA) before the A-Levels, 
  and would consider my admission based only on prelim grades. 
  At the time, I already knew that I wanted to enter an engineering/architecture related course, 
  and so applying for the scholarship would not only serve as a 'safeguard' for me in case my A-level grades were not satisfactory, 
  but also guarantee at least an admission into a course which I was interested in.  </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q3. Did your experiences in VRMC help you in attaining this scholarship? </h3>
<p> I like to think that my VRMC experience helped me attain this scholarship. 
  VRMC gave me a lot of opportunities to be creative and come up with out of the box solutions. 
  It has helped widen my scope, and has taught me to be innovative. I feel that the skills that VRMC has allowed me to develop 
  (such as basic electronics + maker related skills like woodworking/metalworking etc.) 
  are highly relevant and desirable to have, and consequently helped me attain the scholarship. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q4. What is one thing you're passionate about? </h3>
<p> Even prior to VRMC, I was interested in making/creating stuff. 
  The concept of being able to make your own items felt really fun to me. 
  I spent lots of time woodworking/plastic-working even during JC, where I created lots of gadgets (most of which are useless/cosmetic). 
  It was something which I was highly interested in, and it was something which I could further hone in VRMC. 
  It was also the reason why I flunked my CT2s :) </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q5. What is one piece of advice you wish you knew at 18 years old? </h3>
<p> "Get out of your comfort zone, and be the change you want to see. You will never know what life is on the other side if you are unwilling to experience change. 
  Even though it may feel weird/ scary, but you never know until you try it out at least once. 
  Your situation will never change if you keeping doing the same stuff over.
 ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results."" - ?
If you feel something has to be done, nothing is going to happen if you just stand idly be and let life go by. 
  You have to stand up and do what has to be done in order for what you want to become reality."</p>
</br>
</br>

<h3> Any other comments? </h3>
<p>Don't treat CCAs in JC as just a tool to get you to the course you want to enter. 
  JC life is highly stressful. Motivation may be hard to come by with just mugging and sleeping in lectures. 
  If you treat CCA sessions like just another lecture/tutorial for you to overcome, then it won't be rewarding, 
  and you'll find yourself burning out sooner than you thought you would. 
  So my advice is to make the best of it and enjoy your time in CCA. Have a fun 2 years instead of treating it like a chore, and feel miserable throughout</p>
