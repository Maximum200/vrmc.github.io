<h3> Q1: What is one fond memory you have of VRMC? </h3>
<p> The fondest memory I have of my time in VRMC would be spending time with my friends/CCA-mates working on a VEX competition play field. 
  We often spent 3-5 days after school in the robotics lab cutting out parts and building structures for the play field. 
  Although it was a really time consuming and tiring project, it was a breath of fresh air compared to the tiring mugger lifestyle of the typical JC student, 
  and it also provided the extra benefit of giving me more time to interact and have fun with my CCA-mates and friends. 
  Even then, every session was something I looked forward to, and made my JC life that much more wholesome and enjoyable. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q2. What made you apply for this scholarship? </h3>
<p> I applied for the SUTD Global Merit Scholarship under the Special Scholarship Agreement (SSA) before the A-Levels, 
  and would consider my admission based only on prelim grades. 
  At the time, I already knew that I wanted to enter an engineering/architecture related course, 
  and so applying for the scholarship would not only serve as a 'safeguard' for me in case my A-level grades were not satisfactory, 
  but also guarantee at least an admission into a course which I was interested in.  </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q3. Did your experiences in VRMC help you in attaining this scholarship? </h3>
<p> I like to think that my VRMC experience helped me attain this scholarship. 
  VRMC gave me a lot of opportunities to be creative and come up with out of the box solutions. 
  It has helped widen my scope, and has taught me to be innovative. I feel that the skills that VRMC has allowed me to develop 
  (such as basic electronics + maker related skills like woodworking/metalworking etc.) 
  are highly relevant and desirable to have, and consequently helped me attain the scholarship. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q4. What is one thing you're passionate about? </h3>
<p> Even prior to VRMC, I was interested in making/creating stuff. 
  The concept of being able to make your own items felt really fun to me. 
  I spent lots of time woodworking/plastic-working even during JC, where I created lots of gadgets (most of which are useless/cosmetic). 
  It was something which I was highly interested in, and it was something which I could further hone in VRMC. 
  It was also the reason why I flunked my CT2s :) </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q5. What is one piece of advice you wish you knew at 18 years old? </h3>
<p> "Get out of your comfort zone, and be the change you want to see. You will never know what life is on the other side if you are unwilling to experience change. 
  Even though it may feel weird/ scary, but you never know until you try it out at least once. 
  Your situation will never change if you keeping doing the same stuff over.
 ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results."" - ?
If you feel something has to be done, nothing is going to happen if you just stand idly be and let life go by. 
  You have to stand up and do what has to be done in order for what you want to become reality."</p>
</br>
</br>

<h3> Any other comments? </h3>
<p>Don't treat CCAs in JC as just a tool to get you to the course you want to enter. 
  JC life is highly stressful. Motivation may be hard to come by with just mugging and sleeping in lectures. 
  If you treat CCA sessions like just another lecture/tutorial for you to overcome, then it won't be rewarding, 
  and you'll find yourself burning out sooner than you thought you would. 
  So my advice is to make the best of it and enjoy your time in CCA. Have a fun 2 years instead of treating it like a chore, and feel miserable throughout</p>

<h3> Q1: What is one fond memory you have of VRMC? </h3>
<p> 2019 VEX competition! I joined my juniors for the competition because I couldn't make it for my own batch's competition. 
  I was kind of nervous at the start because I didn't know my juniors as well as my own batch but they were super nice the whole time and 
  I'm really grateful for the chance to bond with them. That month of preparation was some of the most fun I had at VRMC, 
  probably because of the whole going "back to school every day of the June holiday to beg the robot to work" part. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q2. What made you apply for this scholarship? </h3>
<p> IRAS (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore) isn't the first place you'll expect computer science to come in handy, 
  but after a bit of research and asking around I found out that IRAS has a pretty strong IT department which welcomes innovation as well as a positive company culture.
  That made me interested enough to try to apply. As to why I didn't apply for the Smart Nation or similar scholarships, 
  I'm a Singapore PR, which meant that I couldn't apply for most other scholarships. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q3. Did your experiences in VRMC help you in attaining this scholarship? </h3>
<p> Yep, definitely! Many of the interview questions were about leadership (not just official roles) and overcoming challenges. 
  VRMC has so many projects that at some point of time you're bound to face challenges and work with many different types of people, 
  so you can use those experiences to answer those questions. I didn't hold an official leadership role in my time in VJ, 
  but that didn't stop me from being able to describe my role as a team member and my role in helping to solve problems. </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q4. What is one thing you're passionate about? </h3>
<p> Trying new things and picking up new skills, I guess. 
  That's the main reason why I joined VRMC in the first place, 
  because none of my previous schools had robotics clubs and I was always interested in trying it out.</p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q5. What is one piece of advice you wish you knew at 18 years old? </h3>
<p> Start early if you want to build up your interview skills/portfolio. I'm not the most confident person, 
  so interviews tend to scare me especially if I have no idea how to answer a question... 
  And that's why researching into the organization is a good idea before you sit for the interview. 
  As for the portfolio, J2 is essentially 24/7 mugging which doesn't leave you with a lot of room to sign up for events and competitions and all that, 
  unless you're a time management master or something.</p>

<h3> Q1: What is one fond memory you have of VRMC? </h3>
<p> Spending extra time in the lab just working on our own projects was really fun :) 
  I used to open the lab to work on some 3D printing projects. My batch mates noticed and joined to started working on other things too. 
  Sometimes we'd work on items for upcoming events/competition and we may be a bit more tense, 
  but being a bonded cohort we supported each other and always finished our work on time.  </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q2. What made you apply for this scholarship? </h3>
<p>I applied to SUTD as the curriculum was more projects based. 
  The school being relatively new would hopefully also mean greater flexibility in the projects or events we can host. 
  Frankly speaking, I applied for the scholarship to cover the tuition fees. 
  SHARP was the main highlight as it would allow me to continue doing research in university, which is where I think I am heading in terms of career.</p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q3. Did your experiences in VRMC help you in attaining this scholarship? </h3>
<p> Yes, for sure! All the events that I participated in while in VRMC were valid talking points during the interview. 
  People like hearing stories, and because of the wide range of events, there is always something I can share from my time here.  </p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q4. What is one thing you're passionate about? </h3>
<p> I'm passionate about learning. Be it about physics, or about people, I just want to learn as much as I can about the world and its workings. 
  This fuels my desire to join the research industry as well, 
  to learn in much greater detail on how to world functions and if I can do anything at all to make it better.</p>
</br>
</br>
<h3> Q5. What is one piece of advice you wish you knew at 18 years old? </h3>
<p> Make time for the people and things that matter to you. Yes, it is important to be responsible for whatever you signed up for. 
  But no matter how busy you get, setting some time aside to check on your friends and family is important too.</p>
</br>
